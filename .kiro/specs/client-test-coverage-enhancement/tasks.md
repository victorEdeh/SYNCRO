# Implementation Plan: Client Test Coverage Enhancement

## Overview

This implementation plan establishes comprehensive test coverage for the client application using TypeScript, Vitest, React Testing Library, and Playwright. The approach follows the test pyramid principle (70% unit, 20% integration, 10% E2E) and introduces reusable test utilities, coverage enforcement, and flaky test detection. All tasks build incrementally, with checkpoints to ensure stability before proceeding.
