# Synchro Project - Current State

**Last Updated**: April 2026  
**Project Phase**: MVP Development - Advanced Stage
**Document Owner**: Engineering Team
**Update Cadence**: Every Sprint / Major Feature Release

## Executive Summary

Synchro is a self-custodial subscription management platform that empowers users to control their recurring payments using crypto. The project has evolved significantly and now features a robust **backend** with 20+ functional API routes and 30+ core services, a set of specialized **smart contracts** for the Stellar Soroban network, and a **client** (Next.js frontend) that is fully integrated with a real Supabase database. The core subscription management engine, risk detection system, and reminder engine are all operational.

## 1. Client Folder (`/client`)

### Status: ✅ **Fully Functional** (Integrated with Real Backend)

#### ✅ What's Implemented

**Frontend UI/UX (100% Complete)**
- Complete dashboard with real-time subscription cards and analytics
- Subscription management (Full CRUD operations with Supabase persistence)
- Team management interface (Integrated with backend team routes)
- Settings page with profile, security (MFA), and integration management
- Notifications panel with real-time alerts
- Onboarding flow for new users
- Command palette (Ctrl+K) for quick navigation
- Dark mode support and responsive design

**Data Integration & State**
- **Supabase Integration**: Real database connection established using `@supabase/ssr`
- **Real Data Persistence**: All user data, subscriptions, and settings persist in PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Fully implemented using Supabase Auth, enforced via Next.js middleware
- **MFA Support**: Integrated multi-factor authentication flow

**Business Logic & Utilities**
- Advanced currency conversion and exchange rate tracking
- Smart duplicate detection for subscriptions
- Detailed audit logging for all user actions
- Performance optimizations (memoization, debouncing, request deduplication)

#### ⚠️ What's Partially Implemented
- **Email Parsing**: UI is ready; backend services exist for Gmail/Outlook but deep parsing logic is undergoing refinement.
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe and Paystack are configured; live payment flows are being finalized.

#### ❌ What's Not Implemented
- **Fully Automated On-Chain Payments**: Currently waiting for non-custodial Stellar card issuance availability.

- Advanced Rate Limiting (Redis-backed) on sensitive endpoints
- Structured logging with PII redaction and audit service integration

**API Endpoints (20+ Routes)**
- `subscriptions`: Full CRUD, bulk operations, and renewal history
- `analytics`: Spending trends, category breakdown, and forecasts
- `team`: Role-based member management and invitations
- `user`: Profile management and user preferences

- `risk-score`: Intelligent risk assessment for subscriptions
- `suggestions`: AI-powered money-saving recommendations
- `compliance`: Automated compliance checks and data export (GDPR)
- `webhooks`: Support for Stripe and Paystack payment events

**Services (30+ Core Services)**
- **Reminder Engine**: Automated multi-channel notifications
- **Risk Detection**: Pattern matching to identify billing anomalies
- **Blockchain Service**: Integration with Stellar Soroban contracts
- **Email Service**: Integration with Gmail/Outlook APIs for scanning
- **Analytics Service**: Complex data aggregation for spending insights
- **Idempotency**: Ensuring reliable processing of state-changing requests

#### ✅ Security Features
- Secret Management via `SecretProvider` interface
- Recursive log masking for sensitive data
- MFA and session security enforcement

## 3. Contracts Folder (`/contracts`)

### Status: ✅ **Functional Smart Contracts** (Beyond Placeholders)

#### ✅ What's Implemented

**Smart Contracts (Stellar Soroban)**
- `subscription_renewal`: Logic for handling recurring payment cycles
- `virtual-card`: Interface for non-custodial card interaction
- `escrow`: Secure holding of funds for pending payments
- `agent-registry`: Management of authorized renewal agents
- `subscription_logging`: On-chain audit trail for subscription events

**Infrastructure**
- Soroban workspace with SDK 23
- Automated deployment scripts and test snapshots
- Detailed documentation for delegated execution and renewal windows

#### ❌ What's Not Implemented
- **Mainnet Deployment**: Currently tested on Testnet; awaiting final security audit.

## Critical Path to MVP Completion

### Priority 1: Production Hardening
1. Finalize payment provider webhooks for production environments.
2. Complete security audit for smart contracts.
3. Optimize database queries for large-scale subscription datasets.

### Priority 2: Integration Refinement
1. Improve email parsing accuracy for specialized merchant invoices.
2. Enhance Telegram bot for richer interaction with the subscription engine.
